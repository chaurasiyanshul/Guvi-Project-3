# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The process involves:

1. **Loading and exploring the MNIST dataset:** The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing and resizing the image data to be suitable for the CNN model.
3. **Building the CNN model:** Creating a sequential model with Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.
4. **Training the model:** Compiling and training the model on the training data.
5. **Evaluating the model:** Assessing the model's performance on the test data.
6. **Making predictions:** Using the trained model to predict digits from new images.

The trained model is saved as a pickle file (`handwritten.pkl`).

## How to access the saved model

You can access the saved model file `handwritten.ipynb` directly from this GitHub repository.

Alternatively, if you are using Google Colab, you can clone this repository and load the model using the following steps:
